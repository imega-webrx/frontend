Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O.

existing data, depending on the type of process.

    to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their
    transliterated equivalents.
    This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical
    to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
    other non-formatting related operations.

    Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.

    Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.

    Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
    sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
    "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
    address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
    address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
    used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and
    "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
    an address can be selected based on the language.

    The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
    of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
    address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
    approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
    made about any of the address components until it was at least
    partially resolved.

    Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
    then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
    addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be
    localities or administrative areas).
